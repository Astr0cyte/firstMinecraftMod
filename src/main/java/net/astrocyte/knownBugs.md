* Pulsar lantern does not work as intended.
* I am yet to understand how to do textures for complex blocks that comprise the traditional 16x16 silhouette.
* From my understanding, if I want a "pink variant" of a lantern, all I have to do is create a custom instance of a LanternBlock object.
  * Perhaps checking how a Soul Lantern works is a good way to approach this.
